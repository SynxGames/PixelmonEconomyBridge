# PixelmonEconomyBridge (SynxGames Rewrite)

This is a rewrite of [PixelmonEconomyBridge by EverNife](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pixelmoneconomybridge.97889/).
This plugin removes the EverNife core dependency and removes 1.12.2 support and modernises the plugin.

For Synx Games needs, the EverNife core dependency (and support for FinalEconomy) was not important to us, so 
this has been removed so we can improve maintainability for our servers.

This has been made open-source as the actual logic from the original plugin does not massively change. The package has
been changed to enforce that this is not a drop-in replacement for the version by EverNife.

## Support

No support is provided for this rewrite. Please do not message SynxGames or EverNife for support - you are on your own!
